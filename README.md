## cardano-topology-alliance
A group to interconnect reliable relays on the Cardano Network

#### Goal:
Currently there is no transparency regarding whether our relays are listed in any other topology file and if listed, 
whether a relays was restarted using that very topology file. Each pool operator can only hope that others list his/her
relays.

This bears the risk of not being properly connected to get our blocks on chain.

To increase the chance of being properly connected to the network, members of this group promise to utilize one or more 
of their relays to list all members of this alliance.

Effect: If any one member is listed on a well connected relay, each of the members of this group are also connected to 
the network.

To increase the chance of being well connected, each member should enlist on the IOHK peer list and try to ask other 
pool operators directly to include their relays in their lists as fixed entries.

#### Members

#### TITAN - https://www.titanstaking.io/

TITAN will dedicate 1 or 2 of its relays to this alliance, while all other (at least 2) relays will be connected to 
random relays to enable those random pool operators to produce blocks.

#### ATADA - https://stakepool.at/

Author of the well regarded script collection:

#### SPIKE - https://spike.crypto2099.io/



#### External relays

We should accept submission of external pool operators which we add to our other relays manually. Since our relays are 
interconnected, each of our x members could add (external / x) entries to his other topology files. This would ensure 
that those external pool operators add at least one of our relays.
